git push        now dont need origin and master since 1 push was done

did new file

 git commit
 git push origin master  this i needed I think the first time because 
                         original repo is bare, this works

did clone on pi
 git clone location

did on pi, bare as non bare does not allow push without a force of some kind
 git init --bare
